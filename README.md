# SwerveX3
This project is for a learning sample for FRC team 8517. The intent is only for a off season Swerve Drive system that uses 3 modules not 4. 
This code utilized the 2023 Beta 6 SwerveBot example.

## Robot
Three wheel SwerveX modules from WCP. All motors are FalconFX and utilize a CANCoder for absolute position.

## Testing
As of December 10 none of the code has been tested.

## SysID
SysID has not been used to set the gains since WPI forgot to add it into the 2023 beta 6 release.
